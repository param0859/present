Salesforce Deliverable: 

Part 1: 
On Contact Object, I created a field Account_Industry__c which is a text field. Since we need to consider any creation or updated on Contact record, and need to make sure there is an account present, I added this in the after update and after insert method. 


Part 2: 
On Account object, I created a custom field, Number_Of_Contacts__c, which is a number field. 
The batch job implemented can be scheduled through apex to update the Number of Contacts on each Account. 

Can be scheduled so it runs everyday through Scheduled Apex or through script. 


Part 3: 
This is partially completed to the best of my ability. 
I fetched the fields from Account and showing on the page the value from the Account record selected.
